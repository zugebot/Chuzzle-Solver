This Java program is a solver for the game Chuzzle. 
Chuzzle is a tile-moving puzzle game where the objective is to match a preliminary state to a goal state.
The chuzzles can be moved horizontally or vertically, and when they go off the side, they wrap around back to the other.

Essentially, this iterates through sets of permutations to the board, to find paths between the states.
